# Get Organized!

## organize.py
Developed a directory organizer because I was feeling lazy :grimacing: sorting out my Downloads folder's files according to their file types. 
- Description: This program will organize the directory in its current state and if left running in the background, the new files added to the folder will be automatically detected and moved to the sub-folder it belongs.

## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amanptl/get-organized
cd get-organized
python organize.py <directory_to_organize>
```
