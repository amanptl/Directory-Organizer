# Directory Organizer

Felt lazy :grimacing: organizing my Downloads folder by file types and developed a python program to automate the task. This program will organize the directory in its current state. And if left running in background it will automatically detect if new files are added and move it to the sub-folder it belongs.

Usage: python organize.py <direcotry_to_organize>
